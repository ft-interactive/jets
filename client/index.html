      <h2>Inside the world of executive jet perquisites at the biggest US companies</h2>
      <p>At the same time Najib Razak, Malaysia’s prime minister, is under pressure to explain the $680m that ended up in his personal bank account, officially from the Saudi royal family. The prime minister says it was a political contribution and denies it is linked to 1MDB. The revelation of the payment, however, has rocked Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy and threatens the near six-decade rule of the governing United Malays National Organisation.</p>
      <p> It is not just a matter of domestic politics. The impact of the cases is being felt way beyond Malaysia’s borders due to the amount of money allegedly involved and its scope. The parties said to be affected include foreign officials, leading banks and offshore financial centres, with transactions stretching from Kuala Lumpur to the Cayman Islands and from Abu Dhabi to New York.</p>
      <p> 1MDB has become a test of regulators’ ability, and desire, to penetrate a web of dealings that take full advantage of the privacy and cross-border complexity available in the global financial system. It is also being seen as a measure of how well authorities deal with cases of suspected grand corruption. Laws have been tightened worldwide to force regulators and companies to gather more ownership information, in the wake of scandals such as the looting of billions of dollars from Nigeria by General Sani Abacha, the late dictator. </p>

The prime minister says it was a political contribution and denies it is linked to 1MDB. The revelation of the payment, however, has rocked Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy and threatens the near six-decade rule of the governing United Malays National Organisation.</p>
        <p> It is not just a matter of domestic politics. The impact of the cases is being felt way beyond Malaysia’s borders due to the amount of money allegedly involved and its scope. The parties said to be affected include foreign officials, leading banks and offshore financial centres, with transactions stretching from Kuala Lumpur to the Cayman Islands and from Abu Dhabi to New York.</p>
        <p> 1MDB has become a test of regulators’ ability, and desire, to penetrate a web of dealings that take full advantage of the privacy and cross-border complexity available in the global financial system. It is also being seen as a measure of how well authorities deal with cases of suspected grand corruption. Laws have been tightened worldwide to force regulators and companies to gather more ownership information, in the wake of scandals such as the looting of billions of dollars from Nigeria by General Sani Abacha, the late dictator. </p>
